**<u>Update on Anti-Money Laundering/Countering Terrorism Financing/ Counter Proliferation Financing (AML/CFT/CPF) matters</u>**

Dear licensee,
 
As a measure to combat money laundering, financing of terrorism and financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, moneylenders in Singapore are required to comply with the Moneylenders Act 2008 and the Moneylenders (Prevention of Money Laundering, Terrorism Financing and Proliferation Financing) Rules 2009.  Moneylenders are also expected to familiarise themselves and comply with the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992 and Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act 2002.

In this regard, to ensure awareness and apprise licensees of their obligations as set out above, MinLaw will be writing periodically to notify you of relevant updates from the Financial Action Task Force and relevant Government agencies. 

As these updates may affect your AML/CFT/CPF compliance obligations, we encourage you to review the notices and the materials referred to in the notices thoroughly, and share them with the relevant personnel in your company.

In this connection, we seek to update you that the Financial Action Task Force has issued statements dated 13 June 2025 on “High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action” and “Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring”, which can be accessed at:
