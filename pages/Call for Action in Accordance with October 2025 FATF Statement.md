**<u>Update on Anti-Money Laundering/Countering Terrorism Financing/ Counter Proliferation Financing (AML/CFT/CPF) matters</u>**

Dear licensed / exempt moneylender,
 
As a measure to combat money laundering, financing of terrorism and financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, moneylenders in Singapore are required to comply with the Moneylenders Act 2008 and the Moneylenders (Prevention of Money Laundering, Terrorism Financing and Proliferation Financing) Rules 2009.  Moneylenders are also expected to familiarise themselves and comply with the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992, Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act 2002 and United Nations Act 2001 (UN Act) and Regulations made under the UN Act.

In this regard, to ensure awareness and apprise licensed / exempt moneylenders  of their obligations as set out above, MinLaw will be writing periodically to notify you of relevant updates from the Financial Action Task Force and relevant Government agencies. 


In this connection and pursuant to rule 6F of the Moneylenders (Prevention of Money Laundering, Terrorism Financing and Proliferation Financing) Rules 2009, the Registrar hereby notifies you that the Financial Action Task Force has issued statements dated 24 October 2025 on “High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action” and “Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring”, which can be accessed at:
