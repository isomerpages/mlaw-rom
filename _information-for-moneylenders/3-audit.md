Licensees are required under the section 24A(1) of the Moneylenders Act (“the Act”) to appoint an auditor to carry out an audit of their accounts every year. The Registrar of Moneylenders (“Registrar”) may also appoint an auditor for the same purpose under the circumstances mentioned in section 24(3) of the Act.

**Additional Duties**

Pursuant to section 24A(5) of the Act, the Registrar of Moneylenders (“Registrar”) hereby notifies the auditor appointed under section 24A(1) or section 24A(3) of the Act (“appointed auditor”) to impose the following duties in addition to those stated in section 24A(4) of the Act:

1. to provide a report that the statements submitted to the Registrar after the end of each quarter of a year starting from the first day of January, April, July or October of the year pursuant to section 24(3) of the Act are accurate; and
2. to provide a report that the licensee has complied with section 30R(1) of the Act. Specifically, in respect of section 30R(1)(a), an appointed auditor shall certify that the borrower information provided by the licensee to the designated credit bureau is accurate, complete and current, after verifying that such borrower information is consistent with the borrower information collected by the licensee.

**Submission of Auditor’s Report and Auditor’s Certificate**

Pursuant to section 24A(8) of the Act, licensees must submit, or cause to be
submitted, the following to the Registry of Moneylenders by 30 April of every calendar year:

2. a copy of the auditor’s report made pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Registrar’s
Notice.

The attention of all appointed auditors is drawn to section 24A(9) of the Act, which provides that the auditor must immediately report the matter to the Registrar if in the course of performing the auditor’s duties, he is satisfied that:
1. there has been a serious breach or non-observance of the provisions of the Act;
2. a criminal offence involving fraud or dishonesty has been committed; or
3. serious irregularities have occurred, including irregularities that compromise the confidentiality, security or integrity of any data obtained, used or disclosed by the licensee.

Appointed auditors should also take note that any non-compliance of section 24A(5) or (9) is an offence under of the Act, and the auditor shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $30,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.
