#### Mandatory Rostered Routine Testing for Licensed Moneylenders

As Singapore transits to living with COVID-19, the Government has updated its testing strategy to detect and ringfence infections and minimise community spreading. The Government has now implemented a mandatory Fast and Easy Test (“FET”) Rostered Routine Testing (“RRT”) regime to business settings which involve frequent community interactions so as to ensure service continuity.

Licensed moneylenders provide an essential service to the community by providing loans to individuals who are unable to obtain credit from the financial institutions. Hence, licensed moneylenders have been identified as businesses that will be required to implement FET RRT at their place of business. By implementing FET RRT, licensed moneylenders will be part of Singapore’s collective efforts in minimising community spreading and will help to safeguard the health of their employees and borrowers, and ensure the continuity of business.<br><br>



**Questions & Answers Regarding the Mandatory Fast and Easy Test (FET) Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) Regime**
<br><br>
1.   What is FET RRT? When are licensed moneylenders required to conduct FET RRT?

     As part of Singapore’s testing strategy, licensed moneylenders are required to do regular self-testing every 7 days (depending on your vaccination status). This will commence as soon as the antigen rapid tests (ART) kits are collected. We will update licensed moneylenders when we have more details on the distribution of ART kits.
<br>

 
2.   Why are licensed moneylenders on mandatory FET RRT regime?

     Licensed moneylenders are assessed to be providing essential services; i.e. provide loans to persons who are unable to obtain credit from the financial institutions. Hence, as part of the safeguards to ensure service continuity, FET RRT will be made mandatory for licensed moneylenders.
<br>

 
3.   What happens if a licensed moneylender chooses not to conduct FET RRT?

     This is a mandatory regime. All licensed moneylenders must conduct self-testing for their employees.
<br>
 
 
4.   My company is already on mandatory FET RRT as directed by another Government agency. What should I do?

     Please write in to us directly with the details and we will advise you accordingly.
<br>
 
 
5.   All my employees are vaccinated. Are we still required to do self-testing?

     Yes, frequent testing continues to be an important part of the MTF’s strategy to ringfence COVID-19 transmissions and contain the spread of infections in the community.
<br> 
 

6.   Are all of my employees required to do self-testing?

     Only employees who are unable to work from home and need to physically return to the moneylending place of business are required to do self-testing. In other words, debt collectors who do not operate from the moneylending place of business need not be included.
<br>
 
 
7.   Are licensed moneylenders expected to bear the costs of these ART kits?

     The costs for testing will be borne by the Government until 31 December 2021.
<br>
 
 
8.   Who will supervise these tests? How will the testing be conducted?

     Licensed moneylenders will be under Employer-Supervised Self-Swab (ESSS), where employees will perform the swab themselves under the supervision of a trained staff (the “Supervisor”). Representatives from licensed moneylenders will be required to undergo training provided by HPB on how the supervision under ESSS is to be carried out. More details regarding this training session will be released later.
<br>

 
9.   How and where should my employees submit their test results?

     Licensed moneylenders will be on Swab Registration System (SRS) where the Supervisor can upload the employees’ test results. More details on SRS will be released later.
<br>

 
10.  When will the ART kits be delivered?

     Due to logistical limitations, ART kits will not be delivered directly to each licensed moneylender’s place of business. We seek your cooperation to collect the kits from a single location. More details on the collection of ART kits will be given soon.
<br>
 
 
11.  Must all my employees go for vaccination?

     We strongly encourage every employee to be vaccinated if he/she is medically fit to do so.
<br>
 
 
12.  Why must the Registry of Moneylenders know the vaccination status of my employees?

     The frequency of the self-testing differs depending on the individual’s vaccination status. We will need the information to calculate the number of ART kits to be delivered.
<br>
 
 
13.  The “Sheet A” tab is only applicable for employees who are unable to work from home (i.e. physically in the office). What about my other employees who are working from home?

     As these employees are working from home, the FET RRT is not applicable to them. No ART kit will be provided to this group of employees.
<br>

 
14.  What if one of the employees who is usually working from home needs to return to the office? Does he/she need to do self-testing before returning office?

     For employees who are working from home, licensed moneylenders are encouraged to purchase ART kits and conduct testing for these employees as and when they need to return to the office (preferably before their return to office).
