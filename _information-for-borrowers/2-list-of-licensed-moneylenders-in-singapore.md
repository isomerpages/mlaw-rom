There have been recent reports of loan scams, where perpetrators masquerade as licensed moneylenders in an attempt to deceive the victims into transferring funds to them. They have possible links to unlicensed moneylending as well. You may wish to refer to the [Police Advisory on Loan Scams](https://www.police.gov.sg/media-room/news/20200102_others_loan_scams){:target=" blank"} for more information.

**Important note:** A licensed moneylender must meet a loan applicant <b><u>in person at the approved place of business before granting any loans.</u></b>


Licensed moneylenders are **disallowed** to solicit for loans via text messages or phone calls. If you have received such a message or phone call, it is likely that an unlicensed moneylender has approached you.

**Do not respond** to the message or call. 

Report possible unlicensed moneylending activities to the Police hotline at 1800-255-000, or submit the information online at [www.police.gov.sg/iwitness](https://www.police.gov.sg/iwitness){:target="_blank"}. Members of the public may also call the National Crime Prevention Councilâ€™s X-Ah Long hotline at 1800-924-5664.
